A military simulator written in Rust, GDScript and made in Godot.

It aims to be a complete 3D environment simulation geared towards military games, including:
* Dynamic, procedural weather system which simulates everything from temperature to humidity, together with volumetric and interactive clouds that react to the environment parameters each day. (Work-in-progress)
* Erosion system which converts any heightmap to a realistic landscape and automatically creates lakes and rivers. (Done)
* Vegetation system which takes into account average yearly sunlight, soil type, and overall climate to populate the world with realistic trees, bushes, and other kinds of vegetation. (Work-in-progress)
* Accurate terrain texturing based on real-life satellite data and user-chosen premade climates. (Done)

The actual gameplay is also on the works, and will have its own description soon.

OpenBattlesim is a revamp of my previous project Battlesim. This is being implemented in Godot, with performance-critical systems written in Rust and ported from the previous project.

This is in a very early development stage and isn't meant to be playable yet!
