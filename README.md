# OpenBattlesim
A military simulator written in Rust, GDScript and made in Godot.

Revamp of previous project Battlesim. This is being implemented in Godot, with performance-critical systems written in Rust and ported from the previous project.

This is in a very early development stage and isn't meant to be playable yet!
